## Handwritten Word Recognition for Indian Languages using CRNN

### Problem Statement

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized the way we process and analyze written text. However, existing OCR algorithms have primarily been developed for English and other Western languages, leaving many non-Latin scripts, such as Indic languages, underrepresented. The goal is to develop an OCR algorithm specifically tailored for Indic languages. The algorithm will be designed to recognize and accurately process complex scripts, ligatures, and diacritical marks in Indic languages, and will be optimized for a variety of Indic languages and dialects. By doing so, this project seeks to enhance OCR technology for Indic languages, providing more accurate and efficient processing for individuals, organizations, and industries that rely on it.
